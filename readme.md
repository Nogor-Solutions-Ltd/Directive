## Introduction

ðŸŒŸ Transform your Laravel Blade views with our user-friendly custom directive package â€“ making development a breeze and sprinkling joy into your code! âœ¨


## Installation

You can install the package using composer

```sh
$  composer require nogorsolutionsltd/directives
```

Then add the service provider to `config/app.php`. In Laravel versions 5.5 and beyond, this step can be skipped if package auto-discovery is enabled.

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
     NogorSolutionsLTD\Directive\ServiceProvider::class,
    ...
];
```

You can publish the configuration file and assets by running:

```sh
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=" NogorSolutionsLTD\Directive\ServiceProvider::class,"
```

Now that we have published a few new files to our application we need to reload them with the following command:

```sh
$ composer dump-autoload
```
